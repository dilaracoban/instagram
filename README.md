# Evolution of Instagram Posting Patterns / Eras of @dilarakimdi

## Objective
I love using social media as my diary. I had this private account just for my friends where I posted smallest details of my life along with memes, my blog posts, biology olympiads tricks, YKS (higher education exam) prep tips, my research on molecules, etc. I always knew that there are certain months or days of the month when I post significantly. This project aims to analyze my Instagram posting frequency and content evolution since 2017, identifying trends related to seasons, events, and personal milestones, such as holidays, travels, and exam periods.

## Motivation
Understanding personal social media habits can provide insights into how external factors, seasons, events, and stress influence online activity. This project aims to uncover meaningful patterns and trends that reflect changes in personal behavior and preferences over time.

## Key Findings

### Distribution of Captions Over Time
- The line plot [distOverTime.png] shows a fluctuating posting frequency since 2017. It was most active during january 2019, when I went to the netherlands for the first time for a high school trip I fell in love with the dutch culture and posted my first amsterdam content. I took a lot of pictures.
- First months of 2019 were in general very active. After amsterdam trip I started to try increasing my GPA and apply to netherlands schools. Then the distrbution of school related and scientific content increased and following months were also my most active period.
-  In june 2019, I did my first internship at a hospital. It was very important for me, so I posted lot.
-  In july 2019 I posted only 1 post. I went to a cycling tour for a month and I was camping with limited opportunuties to charge my phone. The only post I shared was as if a farewell to my friends before the tour as I thanked everyone for making me believe such a thing could ever happen. My friends made me brave enough for such an adventure on my own.
-  Post covid peaks are shown and they corrolate to quarantine. As I was under the age of 18 and a turkish citizen I was simply not allowed to go out. So all of our friends were chronically online. Nothing special happened. Just posting because I was bored.
- Decrease noticeable in periods corresponding to exams. I did not use social media much when I prepared for YKS (higher education exam)
- After YKS I was finally able to travel and have fun with my friends. This is a significant time when I felts as if a proper teenager.
- Posting trends significantly reduced post-2021. This is when I started to university. 2021 september was a month when I actively posted, as It was the first month of university and I was exploring istanbul and making a lot of new friends. But then I decided not to post many personal content and accept not so close friends to my accound as well.
- At the begining of 2022 I started posting a lot again. When I joined the theatre club and we were having rehearsals I liked posting my costumes and acting
- At 2023 summer I went to the netherlands .
- At the beginning of 2024 I almost did not post anything.
- 
### Language Distribution in Captions
-  The majority of captions are in Turkish (\~90%), followed by English.A tool I tried to categorize other languages but most were turkish with many stylistic typos and language identifiers misidentified them. 
- See a few examples:



Language: it

Language: id

- The ones whƒ±ch are categorƒ±ed as Italƒ±an all ƒ±ncluded so much "i"s and mosty related to my friends but nothing significant. The ones categorized as indonesian were my personal walk of shame as they were so "ergen" (teenager)
- Norvegian category included misude of the letter √ñ
- Most of the english content is lyrics. However, there are also english captions I posted regarding my friends in Amsterdam.

### Manual Categorization of Posts
- Content was manually categorized into themes such as family, friends, teenage fun, humor, and academic posts. The category ‚ÄúErgence Seyler‚Äù (teenage content) dominated overall. [manualcategories.png]

- The stacked bar chart [manualCategorization.png] indicates specific trends:
  - ‚ÄúErgence Seyler‚Äù shows consistency in high posting periods.
  - Categories like ‚ÄúBilimsel Seyler‚Äù (academic posts) spike during exam periods.
  - Emotional phases like ‚ÄúIngilizce Sarki/Siir Sozu‚Äù (English song/poem quotes) align with stress or reflective moments.
 
  - Erasmus postlari is a catgory related to all my amsterdam content also including the high school erasmus project trip to the netherlands. I went to 2 erasmus programs in my university life and all were in amsterdam. They were in 2023 summer and 2024 summer respectively.
 
  - Bilimsel seyler (science content) had its most popular month in 2019 june, when I had my first chemistry intenship in Kocali university hospital. Also, in 2021 summer I was trying to distract my overloaded brain due to university exam and I read a lot of bilim teknik, coincidentally I posted some.
  - Aile ve arkadaslar (friends and family) are posted on summer holidays and winter holidays. Not much of these content in exam months such as december and april/may
    Inekce seyler strongly corrolate with exam periods as I tend to almost always yap about school work on my social media when I should be studying

### Most Common Words in Captions
- Analysis of captions revealed frequent words like ‚Äúg√ºzel‚Äù (beautiful), ‚Äúbana‚Äù (to me), and ‚Äúfotograf‚Äù (photo).
- Most of turkish stopwords and typos were eliminated. Before elimination most common words included "bir" and "bi". Ergence seyler had more "bi" (one with a typo) and other things had "bir"
- Since it is my own diary that conteins lots of photos, a personal word such as "benim", "bana" ("this girl is mine", "someone gave that to me" "someone told that to me etc.") is common. "of"is also common, that is also because I tend to post when I am stressed and that word indicated stressful moments. It probably is not a word I use that often in my personal life but I tend to post online when I need to yap about things.
- Common words point to a mix of reflective and casual content.

## Conclusion
This project highlights clear patterns in Instagram usage that align with life events and emotional states. Key observations include:
- Posting frequency spikes during holidays, exams, and reflective moments. (For example, Posting more when I visit the netherlands)
  
- Language and content types align with personal and external factors like exams and travels.

- In short, anyone who followed my instagram could get a lot information about my past and the events that changed the way I am today simply by checking my data. By realizing how inactive I become before TEOG and YKS exams and how much of stupid teenager content after that one can realize how hard I studied. Also, the peaks on the first month of university, first month of high school, etc. indicate that I am very much defined by my educational past in also the personal sense

  This saddened me and I started archiving my posts after this homework to protect my data.
